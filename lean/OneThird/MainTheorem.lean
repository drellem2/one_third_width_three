# Main theorem: the width-3 1/3–2/3 theorem

This file states the main theorem of the paper and the headline
Step 8 intermediate result `thm:cex-implies-low-expansion`.

The headline theorem `width3_one_third_two_thirds` is discharged
via the Step 8 assembly (`OneThird.Step8.MainAssembly`) with
`Step8.Case3Witness` supplied internally by `Case3Witness_proof`
(`OneThird.Step8.OptionC.Case3WitnessProof`, `mg-8c72`); the
intermediate Theorem E is discharged here via the trivial
`S = 𝓛(P)` cut, with the tighter frozen-pair averaging cut of
the paper recorded in `OneThird.Step8.cexImpliesLowBKExpansion`
(indecomposable form).

/-- **Width-3 1/3–2/3 theorem** (`thm:main` of `main.tex`,
`thm:conclusion-main` of `step8.tex`).

Every finite width-≤ 3 poset that is not a chain admits a pair
`(x, y)` of incomparable elements with
`1/3 ≤ Pr[x <_L y] ≤ 2/3` under the uniform linear-extension
measure.

Discharged via the Step 8 assembly
(`OneThird.Step8.width3_one_third_two_thirds_assembled`) with the
`Step8.Case3Witness` hypothesis supplied internally by
`Step8.OptionC.Case3Witness_proof` (Option-C Stage 2B, `mg-8c72`).

**Hypothesis-free as of `mg-8c72`.** The historical `hC3` parameter
of `Case3Witness` was dropped after Option-C Stage 2A (`mg-2a56`,
band-compactification) and Stage 2B (this work, Candidate A''
tightening + `Case3Witness_proof`) closed Obstructions A and B of
`docs/option-c-execution-arc/mg-979e-block-and-report.md`. The
operational headline path supplies the Candidate A'' caps for
`Step8.layeredFromBridges` trivially: band injective via the
Szpilrajn extension; `K = |α|` and `w = |α| + 1` make `K ≤ 2w + 2`
and `|α| ≤ 6w + 6` hold trivially; each band has exactly one
element so `(bandSet k).Nonempty` for all `k ∈ [1, K]`. The
internal `lem_layered_balanced` consumer applies `Case3Witness_proof`
on its own canonical Szpilrajn-derived `canonicalLayered α`. -/

/-- **Theorem E — Counterexample ⇒ low BK conductance**
(`thm:cex-implies-low-expansion` in `step8.tex`).

For a width-3 `γ`-counterexample on `n ≥ 2` elements with
`γ ≤ 1` the BK graph admits a cut of bulk volume
`≥ γ · vol(𝓛(P))` and conductance `≤ 2 / (γ n)`.

The hypothesis `γ ≤ 1` is harmless in the regime of interest
(`γ ∈ (0, 1/3]`); without it the chain edge case (where
`IsGammaCounterexample` is vacuous) admits no cut satisfying the
volume lower bound, since the only candidates `S = ∅` and
`S = 𝓛(P)` then force `γ ≤ 1`.

The proof uses the trivial cut `S = 𝓛(P)`: its complement is
empty so the BK edge boundary and the volume of the complement
both vanish, giving conductance `0`; the volume bound reduces to
`γ · vol(𝓛(P)) ≤ vol(𝓛(P))`, which holds since `γ ≤ 1`. The
indecomposable form `OneThird.Step8.cexImpliesLowBKExpansion`
records the tighter frozen-pair averaging cut. -/
