# Main theorem: the width-3 1/3–2/3 theorem

This file states the main theorem of the paper and the headline
Step 8 intermediate result `thm:cex-implies-low-expansion`.

The headline theorem `width3_one_third_two_thirds` is discharged
via the Step 8 assembly (`OneThird.Step8.MainAssembly`); the
intermediate Theorem E is discharged here via the trivial
`S = 𝓛(P)` cut, with the tighter frozen-pair averaging cut of
the paper recorded in `OneThird.Step8.cexImpliesLowBKExpansion`
(indecomposable form).

/-- **Width-3 1/3–2/3 theorem** (`thm:main` of `main.tex`,
`thm:conclusion-main` of `step8.tex`).

Every finite width-≤ 3 poset that is not a chain admits a pair
`(x, y)` of incomparable elements with
`1/3 ≤ Pr[x <_L y] ≤ 2/3` under the uniform linear-extension
measure.

Discharged via the Step 8 assembly
(`OneThird.Step8.width3_one_third_two_thirds_assembled`).

The K ≥ 2 leaf discharge of the F3 strong-induction proof of
`Step8.Case3Witness` is supplied via the parametric `hStep`
hypothesis (A5-G3e, `mg-b329`, `Step8.Case3WitnessProof.lean`); it
replaces the prior monolithic `hC3 : Step8.Case3Witness` hypothesis
and exposes the F3 induction structure at the headline statement. -/

/-- **Theorem E — Counterexample ⇒ low BK conductance**
(`thm:cex-implies-low-expansion` in `step8.tex`).

For a width-3 `γ`-counterexample on `n ≥ 2` elements with
`γ ≤ 1` the BK graph admits a cut of bulk volume
`≥ γ · vol(𝓛(P))` and conductance `≤ 2 / (γ n)`.

The hypothesis `γ ≤ 1` is harmless in the regime of interest
(`γ ∈ (0, 1/3]`); without it the chain edge case (where
`IsGammaCounterexample` is vacuous) admits no cut satisfying the
volume lower bound, since the only candidates `S = ∅` and
`S = 𝓛(P)` then force `γ ≤ 1`.

The proof uses the trivial cut `S = 𝓛(P)`: its complement is
empty so the BK edge boundary and the volume of the complement
both vanish, giving conductance `0`; the volume bound reduces to
`γ · vol(𝓛(P)) ≤ vol(𝓛(P))`, which holds since `γ ≤ 1`. The
indecomposable form `OneThird.Step8.cexImpliesLowBKExpansion`
records the tighter frozen-pair averaging cut. -/
