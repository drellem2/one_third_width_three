## §0. Onboarding TL;DR (read even if you skim nothing else)

* The headline theorem is `OneThird.width3_one_third_two_thirds`
  (`lean/OneThird/MainTheorem.lean:56`). It is **AMBER**: one
  structured `sorry` (relocated to `MainAssembly.lean` integration
  point post-mg-234e) and one named project axiom (plus Brightwell
  is gone from the headline deps as of mg-8c72's Case3Witness_proof
  landing).
* The proof is **layered-decomposition based**, descending through
  `lem_layered_balanced` → (`Case3Witness_proof` ∘ `bounded_irreducible_balanced_hybrid`)
  with Bool-certificate leaves verified by `native_decide`.
* **mg-234e caller's-L rewire** (Option D-narrow per mg-0cbf §5e;
  spec mg-ac13 §5.4): `lem_layered_balanced` K ≥ 2 dispatch now
  takes the five `Case3Witness` cap-antecedents as explicit
  hypotheses on the caller's `L` (no more `canonicalLayered α`
  substitution), so the cap-5 sorry that lived at
  `LayeredBalanced.lean:755` is CLOSED at that site. The
  architectural gap (Steps 1–7's `w₀(γ) ≤ 4` paper-axiomatised
  delivery, mg-ac13 §5.4 forward action 5) is now correctly
  localised at `mainTheoremInputsOf.caseC_canonicalLayered` in
  `MainAssembly.lean` as a structured `sorry`, where the upstream
  `Step7.LayeredWidth3` interface is the intended source.
* The architecture has a **real substantive backbone in the
  |α| ≤ 10 slice** (F3 strong induction inside `Case3Witness_proof`
  + mg-4d7b enumeration). The **|α| ≥ 11 slice is conditional** on
  Steps 1–7's `w₀(γ) ≤ 4` bandwidth bound, which Lean does not yet
  faithfully deliver.
* **Two known historical pitfalls** (§3) — F3 conflation (mg-74d2/mg-82fc)
  and residual over-constraint (mg-5c32). Read §3 BEFORE adding API
  surface from one place to another or restating residuals from
  Case3Witness's call shape.

## §1. Math story in one page

**Goal.** For every finite poset `α` with `width(α) ≤ 3` that is not a
chain, exhibit an incomparable pair `(u, v)` with
`1/3 ≤ Pr[u <_L v] ≤ 2/3` over uniform random linear extensions `L`
of `α`.

**Approach (paper Steps 1–8, `step1.tex`…`step8.tex`).**

1. **Steps 1–7 (paper).** Reduce to a *layered decomposition*
   `L : LayeredDecomposition α` with width-3 bands, bounded interaction
   width `w ≤ w₀(γ)` (paper `prop:72`, `step7.tex:1175-1193`), and the
   four other caps used in §2 below. **Status in Lean:** Steps 1–7
   are paper-axiomatised at the `Step7.LayeredWidth3` interface
   (`Step7/Assembly.lean:302-348`). The current chain-potentials
   extractor (`Step8/ChainPotentials.lean`) ships
   `bandwidth = |α| + 1` (sham); faithful delivery of `w₀(γ) ≤ 4` is
   the long-arc residual (R-broad below).
2. **Step 8 G4 (paper `lem:layered-balanced`, Lean `lem_layered_balanced`,
   `LayeredBalanced.lean:626`).** Given the layered `L` plus the five
   Candidate A'' cap hypotheses (`hInj`, `hKw`, `hCardw`, `hNonempty`,
   `hLw : L.w ≤ 4`), dispatch on `L.K`:
   * `K = 1` — bands forced antichain ≤ 3 elts; close by
     `bipartite_balanced_enum`. **SUBSTANTIVE-AND-FORMALIZED.**
   * `K ≥ 2` — apply `Case3Witness_proof.{u}` (the K-strong-induction
     dispatcher) directly on the caller's `L`. **SUBSTANTIVE post-mg-234e**
     (was VACUOUS-COVER pre-mg-234e). The K ≥ 2 dispatch threads the
     caps to `hC3 α L hInj hKw hCardw hNonempty hLw …`; the cap-5
     sorry that lived at `LayeredBalanced.lean:755` is CLOSED at
     this site. The integration debt (Steps 1–7's `w₀(γ) ≤ 4`
     paper-axiomatised delivery) is now correctly localised at
     `mainTheoremInputsOf.caseC_canonicalLayered` in
     `MainAssembly.lean`. See §3 pitfall #3.
3. **Case3Witness_proof internal F3 strong induction**
   (`OptionC/Case3WitnessProof.lean:256`, `Nat.strong_induction_on`
   at line 286). Descends on `Fintype.card β`. Five caps on `LB`:
   (1) `Function.Injective LB.band`, (2) `LB.K ≤ 2·LB.w+2`, (3)
   `|β| ≤ 6·LB.w+6`, (4) nonempty bands, (5) `LB.w ≤ 4` (mg-d5a0).
   Caps 1+4 collapse bands to singletons (`K=|β|`); caps 2+5 force
   `|β| ≤ 10`. So the non-vacuous scope of `Case3Witness` is
   `|β| ≤ 10`.
4. **Within Case3Witness_proof's recursion** (K-dispatch, all
   substantive backbone in this slice):
   * `K = 1` + cap 1 + `2 ≤ |β|` → contradiction.
   * `K = 2` reducible → chain forced → contradicts `¬IsChainPoset`.
   * `K = 2` irreducible → `OptionC.option_c_K2_closure` via F5a K=2
     `case2_certificate` (`native_decide`).
   * `K ≥ 3` reducible → recurse on `D.Lower`/`D.Upper` via
     `compactify`; lift balanced pair via marginal-invariance from
     `OrdinalDecomp.hasBalancedPair_lift`
     (`Mathlib/LinearExtension/Subtype.lean:1152`) — this is paper
     `lem:ordinal-factorisation` (`step8.tex:2404-2418`). See §3
     pitfall #1.
   * `K ≥ 3` irreducible → `bounded_irreducible_balanced_hybrid` →
     branch on `Decidable(InCase3Scope L.w |β| L.K)`:
     - **in-scope** (K=3, w∈{1..4} per `sizeLimit`; K=4, w=1) →
       `bounded_irreducible_balanced_inScope` consumes
       `case3_certificate` (`Case3Enum/Certificate.lean:71`,
       `native_decide`). **SUBSTANTIVE-COMPUTATIONAL.**
     - **out-of-scope** (K∈{4 w≥2, 5..10} cells) →
       `case3Witness_hasBalancedPair_outOfScope` AXIOM
       (`Case3Residual.lean:208`). Math content **verified by mg-4d7b**
       (Python enumeration of ~1.72M+ configs in the cap-1
       singleton-band sub-slice, no counterexamples; partial Lean
       port at `Case3Enum/Cap5Singletons.lean`). **Cap-light
       extension by mg-be48** (`docs/state-Case3Witness-cap-light-enumeration.md`)
       extends Python enumeration to **non-singleton bands** (cap 1
       dropped, caps 2-5 + L1a retained) for cells with `nfree ≤ 25`
       (TIER A); the very densest cells (`nfree > 25`, e.g.
       K=4 w=1 `[3,3,3,3]`) remain in TIER B and rely on the
       structural argument that they are either ordinal-sum
       reducible (Case B lift) or admit a within-band symmetric
       pair (Pr = 1/2).
5. **External axioms.** `LinearExt.brightwell_sharp_centred`
   (Brightwell–Tetali sharp 1/3 lower bound; `AXIOMS.md:21`).

interface.** (mg-2970's `R1 + R2` framing SUPERSEDED by mg-ac13 — see

* **Step 8 (R1-equivalent)** = Lean port of paper's

  drops the call-shape caps of the existing `Case3Witness_proof.{u}`).
  Discharges `HasBalancedPair α` via the paper's strong induction on
  `|α|`. The current `Case3Witness_proof.{u}` is a *restriction* of
  this covering only the cap-1-cap-5 sub-slice (`|α| ≤ 10` AND admits
  singleton-band bandwidth-`≤ 4` L). **This IS the entire Step 8
  engineering target — NOT a narrow residual.**
* **Steps 1-7 (R2-equivalent, AXIOMATIC interface)** = paper's
  `prop:72` (`step7.tex:1173`) plus the upstream cascade. Delivers
  `L : LayeredDecomposition α` with `L.w ≤ w₀(γ) ≤ 4` *for α arising
  as a minimal γ-counterexample in the (R)+(coherent) regime*. The
  current Lean tree axiomatises this at `Step7.LayeredWidth3`
  (`Step7/Assembly.lean:302-348`). **NOT a free-standing existence
  claim over all width-3 non-chain α** — see pitfall #2 below for
  why mg-2970's universal-quantifier R2 is false.
* See `docs/coherence-collapse-case-extraction.md` (mg-ac13) for
  the structural extraction of the "narrower property" delivered by
  the coherence-collapse case, the 3-disjoint-chains counterexample
  refuting mg-2970 R2 in its full cap-light form, and the
  proof-technique known-ness verdict.

## §3. Known pitfalls — read before re-deriving

These are the two reference cases for "things polecats have got wrong"
plus the standing architectural trap that produced both.

### Pitfall #1 — "F3 strong induction" names two different things

Two constructs in tree are both called "F3 strong induction"; only
one is substantive, and they live in different files. **Do not
conflate.** (Mistake taxonomy from mg-74d2 confirmed/refined by
mg-82fc.)

| Construct | File:Line | Status | What it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| `hasBalancedPair_of_layered_strongInduction[_width3]` | `LayerOrdinal.lean:370/472` | **MARKER** — `L` declared, never used; recursion is on `Fintype.card α` only via an inline `hStep` hypothesis. NOT on the headline path. | Bare F3 framework template. Type-only dispatcher. |
| `Case3Witness_proof.{u}` | `OptionC/Case3WitnessProof.lean:256` (induction at `:286`) | **SUBSTANTIVE.** Its own `Nat.strong_induction_on` on `Fintype.card β` with explicit cap-propagation. NOT the bare framework. | The load-bearing F3 instance for the headline. |

The conclusion-lift in `Case3Witness_proof` K≥3 reducible branch is
**NOT** circular: it eliminates cross-pair incomparability via
`hRed`, recurses on `D.Lower`/`D.Upper` (strict descent on
`Fintype.card`), then lifts via `OrdinalDecomp.hasBalancedPair_lift`
which is paper `lem:ordinal-factorisation` (`step8.tex:2404-2418`)
delivered as `Pr[u<v]`-marginal-invariance from a genuine
`LinearExt α ≃ LinearExt Lower × LinearExt Mid × LinearExt Upper`
bijection (`Mathlib/LinearExtension/Subtype.lean:~700/1065/1152`).

**When auditing F3, ALWAYS state which of the two constructs you're
talking about** and verify it by reading the proof body, not just the
signature.

### Pitfall #2 — Don't transcribe Case3Witness's caps as the residual; don't quantify R2's `∃ L` universally over width-3 non-chain α

`Case3Witness.{u}` (`LayeredBalanced.lean:461`) carries five caps
(see §1). They are an **API surface** of the universal statement
`Case3Witness_proof` discharges, **not** the right shape for the
residual the headline reduces to.

**Three historical over-claims to avoid** (mg-5c32 hit the first
two; mg-2970 corrected those but introduced a third; mg-ac13 closes
the third — see `docs/coherence-collapse-case-extraction.md`):

1. **Stapling caps 1+4+2+5 together gives an unsatisfiable residual
   at `|α| ≥ 11`.** Cap 1 (`Function.Injective L.band`) + cap 4
   (nonempty bands) ⇒ singleton bands ⇒ `|α| = L.K`. Caps 2+5 ⇒
   `L.K ≤ 10`. Together: no L satisfying all five caps exists at
   `|α| ≥ 11`. mg-5c32's `LayeredResidual` (§0 single-part) AND
   `LayeredResidual_broad` (§3c two-part) both made this error.

2. **Claiming mg-4d7b enumeration discharges the `|α| ≤ 10` slice
   over-claims mg-4d7b's scope.** mg-4d7b enumerates the
   **cap-1-cap-5 sub-slice** only (β admitting a singleton-band L
   with bandwidth `≤ 4`). For width-3 non-chain α with `|α| ≤ 10`
   and *no* such L (canonical counterexample: `α = 3-antichain ⊕
   3-antichain`, `|α| = 6`, minimum singleton-band bandwidth = 5,
   but admits w=0 L with two size-3 bands), mg-4d7b's enumeration
   does not cover α even though α has a balanced pair (here
   `(a₁, a₂)` are symmetric, `Pr = 1/2`).

3. **Quantifying R2's `∃ L with L.w ≤ 4` universally over width-3
   non-chain α gives a FALSE statement.** Counterexample (mg-ac13
   §3): `α =` 3 disjoint chains of length 10 (|α| = 30, width 3,
   non-chain). Every layered decomposition of this α has bandwidth
   ≥ 9 (each chain spans 10 distinct band indices by (L1)+(L4),
   and cross-chain incomparable pairs force `|band(x) − band(y)|
   ≤ w` by (L3), giving `w ≥ 9`). So `∀ width-3 non-chain α, ∃ L
   with L.w ≤ 4` is FALSE. The proper Lean shape for "Steps 1-7's
   bandwidth bound" is the **axiomatic interface**
   `Step7.LayeredWidth3` (`Step7/Assembly.lean:302-348`), which
   only applies to α that arise as minimal γ-counterexamples in the
   (R)+(coherent) regime — not to all width-3 non-chain α. **Do
   not chase R2 as a free-standing universal-existence Lean lemma;
   it is false in that form.**

The **right framing is**:

* **Step 8** = Lean port of `lem:layered-balanced` (`step8.tex:2453`):
  `∀ (α, L) with HasWidthAtMost α 3 ∧ ¬IsChainPoset α ∧ 2 ≤ |α| ∧
  L.w ≤ 4, HasBalancedPair α`. This IS the entire engineering target
  (Daniel's "R1 is the entire conjecture" complaint is structurally
  correct — see mg-ac13 §5.1). Proof-technique is known
  (paper-proved strong induction + cited FKG + finite enumeration
  base case); the in-tree gap is engineering, not math.
* **Steps 1-7** = paper-axiomatised `Step7.LayeredWidth3` interface,
  delivering `L : LayeredDecomposition α` with `L.w ≤ 4` for α
  arising as a minimal γ-counterexample in the (R)+(coherent)
  regime. **Not** universally quantified over width-3 non-chain α.

**Before stating "the residual is X", do three checks:**
1. **Satisfiability under caps.** Is X satisfiable at the headline's
   full `|α|` range under all the caps you wrote down? If not,
   you've stapled API hypotheses to a residual that should drop
   some (pitfall #1).
2. **Discharge-coverage of cited artefacts.** If you cite an
   existing artefact (mg-4d7b, `case3_certificate`, …) as the
   discharge, verify that artefact's actual scope matches your
   residual's stated scope. mg-4d7b ≠ "all width-3 non-chain α
   with `|α| ≤ 10`" (pitfall #2).
3. **Universal-quantifier truthfulness.** If your residual quantifies
   universally over width-3 non-chain α with an `∃ L` conclusion,
   construct an explicit counterexample to refute it before
   accepting the form. mg-ac13 §3 builds 3-disjoint-chains-of-10
   as the refutation of mg-2970 R2 (pitfall #2.3).

### Pitfall #3 — `canonicalLayered α` substitution (CLOSED at K≥2 dispatch as of mg-234e; gap relocated to integration point)

**Status post-mg-234e:** `lem_layered_balanced` K ≥ 2 branch
(`LayeredBalanced.lean:681-720`) **now consumes the caller's `L`
directly** with the five `Case3Witness` cap-antecedents
(`hInj`, `hKw`, `hCardw`, `hNonempty`, `hLw : L.w ≤ 4`) passed as
explicit hypotheses. The cap-5 sorry that lived at
`LayeredBalanced.lean:755` is CLOSED at that site.

**The architectural gap moved up, not away.** The integration point
`mainTheoremInputsOf.caseC_canonicalLayered` in `MainAssembly.lean`
still uses `canonicalLayered α` (`K = w = |α|`) to derive caps 1–4
cleanly, and admits cap 5 (`L.w ≤ 4`) as a structured `sorry` —
the Steps 1–7 paper-axiomatised delivery gap, per mg-ac13 §5.4
forward action 5. This is the *correct* localisation: the missing
piece is "Steps 1–7's `prop:72 + rem:w0-constant` cascade
delivering an `L : LayeredDecomposition α` with `L.w ≤ 4` for α
arising as a minimal γ-counterexample". The `Step7.LayeredWidth3`
structure is the placeholder; faithful Lean port is multi-year
(per mg-ac13 §5.3 Daniel "shouldn't even go there yet").

**Pre-mg-234e history.** Prior to mg-234e, the K ≥ 2 branch
discarded the caller's `L` and substituted `canonicalLayered α`
internally, hiding the cap-5 gap inside the dispatch as a
structured `sorry` at `LayeredBalanced.lean:755`. Operationally
this meant: anything the headline appeared to "buy" by threading
an L through the layered API was **fiction at the K≥2 call site**.
Per mg-74d2 §1, the only place layered structure is genuinely
consumed downstream is the F5a Bool-certificate encoding leaf
(`bounded_irreducible_balanced_inScope` via `cross_band_lt_upward`
for `predMaskOf` upper-triangularity) — and that's an encoding
artefact, not a structural insight about α.

**Practical implication.** If a ticket says "use L's bandwidth to
discharge X at the headline," the K ≥ 2 dispatch NOW consumes L
honestly; the work is to supply an `L` with `L.w ≤ 4` at
`mainTheoremInputsOf.caseC_canonicalLayered`. The intended source
is the `Step7.LayeredWidth3` paper-axiom interface; the in-tree
`canonicalLayered α` placeholder fails cap 5 by design.

### Pitfall #4 — Verify "not implemented" / "doesn't exist" claims

Source docs frequently say "we have not yet…" or "X is not in tree."
Some claims have since shipped (e.g., mg-4d7b's K=2..9 Lean ports).
Before assuming a doc's negative claim is current, grep for the
named symbol or `ls` the path. Example checks before action:

* `grep -rn 'case3_balanced_singletons_K9' lean/` — is K=9 cell ported?
* `ls lean/OneThird/Step8/Case3Enum/Cap5Singletons*.lean` — partial
  Lean port present?
* `grep -n 'sorry' lean/OneThird/Step8/LayeredBalanced.lean` — only
  the one cap-5 sorry should appear; if more, the tree has regressed.

**Predecessor audits and state docs (read in order of relevance):**

* `docs/coherence-collapse-case-extraction.md` (mg-ac13) — paper-first
  extraction of the "narrower property" delivered by the coherence-collapse
  case; technique-known verdict; 3-disjoint-chains counterexample
  refuting mg-2970 R2's universal-existence form. **SUPERSEDES
  mg-2970's `R1+R2` framing.**
* `docs/onethird-proof-outline-audit.md` (mg-82fc) — per-step proof-tree
  tag table; the **most thorough** source for the §2 table here.
* `docs/width3-residual-statement.md` (mg-2970) — `R1_paper_faithful +
  R2_exists_bounded_bandwidth` re-extraction. **SUPERSEDED by mg-ac13:
  R1 IS Step 8 in full (not a narrow residual); R2 in its universal-∃
  form is FALSE (mg-ac13 §3 counterexample).** Retain for cross-reference
  to its corrections of mg-5c32, not as the headline residual statement.

## §5. Maintenance contract

This file is the **single-source-of-truth proof-tree summary** for
polecat onboarding (per Daniel directive 2026-05-18T09:37Z, work item
mg-6f04). Update it in the **same commit** as any change that:

* Lands or drops a project axiom (`AXIOMS.md` diff).
* Closes a `sorry` or introduces one (`grep -rn sorry lean/`).
* Restates the headline (`MainTheorem.lean`).
* Re-extracts the residual (mg-5c32-/mg-2970-/mg-ac13-class work) —
  §3 pitfall #2's template must be edited to match the new residual
  shape. **Daniel's "vacuity-discovery" pattern has hit 6 times as of
  mg-ac13** (mg-e2e9, mg-74d2, mg-5c32, mg-82fc, mg-2970, mg-ac13);
  default to skeptical paper-first reading, not API-surface
  transcription.
* Rewires `lem_layered_balanced` or `mainTheoremInputsOf`
  (Option D-narrow / D-broad-class work).
* Refactors `Case3Witness` signature (caps changed) or
  `Case3Witness_proof` body.
* Discharges Steps 1–7's `w₀(γ)` faithfully.
* Surfaces a fresh pitfall worth adding to §3 — error patterns are
  more useful than success summaries.

If you're a polecat reading this and your task touches the proof
tree, **update §1 / §2 inline as you go** and commit the doc change
in the same patch as the Lean change. Don't open a follow-on ticket
to "update onboarding doc"; rot starts there.

If you find this doc is wrong, edit it directly. Source-of-truth is
the Lean tree and `step{1..8}.tex`; this doc is summary.
